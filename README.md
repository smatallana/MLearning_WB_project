# MLearning_WB_project
Machine Learning for Public Policy (UChicago) - final project

## Steps
1) Use python feature_generation.py to add additional features to the data. Change "data/tothecheck.csv" and "data/tothecheck_II.csv" as 
input and output files.

2) Run code from the WB_delivery.ipynb notebook.

3) Output is generated by applying the proposed model to the contracts without any labels (e.g. no unsubstantiated, substantiated, or 
unfounded). Repeat the step of feature generation on such database, changing the "data/tothecheck.csv" names of input and output.
